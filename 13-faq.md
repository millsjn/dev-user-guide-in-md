## How do I set up my Multifactor Authentication
You should be prompted to set up multifactor authentication when you create your account, the options are SMS, voice call, email and the Okta verify application.

## Can I set up more than one form of Multifactor Authentication?
This is recommended. If you lose access to one form of MFA, you would still be able to gain access to your account using an alternative. To do so, please log on to https://adrf.okta.com and select your name on the top right and click settings. Here you can modify or set up your SMS, voice call, email or Okta multifactor authentication.

## How can I reset my Okta password?
You can use the “Need help signing in?” option on the sign on page (https://adrf.okta.com) which will send a link to your email to reset your password. You may have to verify your identify by answering security questions which you set up when creating your account.

## How can I reset my ADRF password?

1. Click on the ADRF Management Portal Okta Tile:

You’ll see a screen where you can choose the project(s) for which you want to update the password.

## What if I do not remember my security questions or if I get locked out?

You would have to reach out to support at support@coleridgeinitiative.org to have your account unlocked and you would have to reset your security questions so that you can recover your account in the future.

## I can log into the ADRF but my desktop and DS application just show blank pages.

Please ensure the connection to ADRF is not being blocked by your organizations VPN and/or firewall (try using a device not connected to your organization’s network) and reach out to [support@coleridgeinitiative.org](mailto:support@coleridgeinitiative.org).

## I saved a file in the C: drive or in the Desktop. When I logged back in, the file is no longer there. Can you restore it?

The ADRF is a temporary workspace environment, files left on the desktop will be removed when you log out of your session, and we cannot restore these files. See section  Best practice is to store files in your user folder on the U: drive
