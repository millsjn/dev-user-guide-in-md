## Introduction

Welcome to the **ADRF** user guide. This is a living document intended to show new ADRF users how to use the platform for common tasks.

### About the Administrative Data Research Facility
The [Coleridge Initiativeâ€™s](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/) Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) is a secure, [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/)-authorized computational research platform that promotes access to and the discovery of sensitive confidential microdata.

### The Five Safes Security Framework
The ADRF follows the Five Safes Framework, a data management framework commonly used in government agencies, to ensure the safe use of sensitive and confidential data assets. It considers five dimensions in making data-related safety and security decisions: Safe Projects, Safe People, Safe Settings, Safe Data, and Safe Exports.
- **Safe Projects** - The ADRF contains only agency approved projects that have been proposed and agreed upon by project and dataset stewards. Only approved projects are housed within ADRF, only approved individuals are granted access to a given project, and project environments are kept separated from each other. These approved projects require signed agreements and only approved users can access the project workspaces within the platform.
- **Safe People** - Only approved researchers are permitted to access project workspaces and related resources. Each individual with approved access must complete security training, agree to the ADRF terms of use, and sign relevant data use agreements. Individuals must authenticate to gain access to the remote platform and all ADRF activity is monitored. 
- **Safe Settings** - The ADRF is designed to provide secure methods of data transfer for agency micro-data, specifically data that includes Personally Identifiable Information. Only agency identified and authorized personnel are invited to perform data transfers.
- **Safe Data** - Before transmission to ADRF, all data with personally identifiable or other sensitive information is hashed, and an online data stewardship application provides data stewards with information on who is accessing their data, how it is being accessed, what projects employ it, the characteristics of each data asset, and the status of user agreements. 
- **Safe Exports** - Users are prevented from unauthorized removal of any information within the secure environment.
