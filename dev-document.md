## Introduction

Welcome to the [Coleridge Initiative’s](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/) Administrative Data Research Facility, or "**ADRF**" user guide. This is a living document intended to show new ADRF users how to use the platform for common tasks.

### About the Coleridge Initiative
The Coleridge Initiative’s mission is to improve the access, usability, and impact of data for public policy by fostering collaboration between government agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders. It aims to create a data ecosystem where government data can be more effectively used to inform evidence-based decision-making, policy development, and research.

### About the Administrative Data Research Facility
The Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) is a platform provided by the Coleridge Initiative that enables researchers to access and analyze administrative data from government agencies securely and efficiently. It offers a secure computing environment where researchers can work with sensitive data while ensuring privacy and confidentiality. The ADRF provides tools and infrastructure for data integration, analysis, and visualization, allowing researchers to conduct rigorous and reproducible studies using large-scale administrative datasets. By facilitating access to valuable data resources and promoting collaboration between researchers, government agencies, and other stakeholders, the ADRF supports evidence-based policymaking and advances research in fields such as public health, education, labor economics, and social policy.

### The Five Safes Security Framework
The ADRF follows the Five Safes Framework, a data management framework commonly used in government agencies, to ensure the safe use of sensitive and confidential data assets. It considers five dimensions in making data-related safety and security decisions: Safe Projects, Safe People, Safe Settings, Safe Data, and Safe Exports.
- **Safe Projects** - The ADRF contains only agency approved projects that have been proposed and agreed upon by project and dataset stewards. Only approved projects are housed within ADRF, only approved individuals are granted access to a given project, and project environments are kept separated from each other. These approved projects require signed agreements and only approved users can access the project workspaces within the platform.
- **Safe People** - Only approved researchers are permitted to access project workspaces and related resources. Each individual with approved access must complete security training, agree to the ADRF terms of use, and sign relevant data use agreements. Individuals must authenticate to gain access to the remote platform and all ADRF activity is monitored. 
- **Safe Settings** - The ADRF is designed to provide secure methods of data transfer for agency micro-data, specifically data that includes Personally Identifiable Information. Only agency identified and authorized personnel are invited to perform data transfers.
- **Safe Data** - Before transmission to ADRF, all data with personally identifiable or other sensitive information is hashed, and an online data stewardship application provides data stewards with information on who is accessing their data, how it is being accessed, what projects employ it, the characteristics of each data asset, and the status of user agreements. 
- **Safe Exports** - Users are prevented from unauthorized removal of any information within the secure environment.

## ADRF Access and Account Set Up

### Requesting an Account
- **Agency-affiliated researcher**. If you are an agency-affiliated researcher, your agency will set up an ADRF account for you.
- **Individual part of a training program**. If you are part of a [training program](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/applied-data-analytics-training-programs), the Coleridge Initiative team will create an account for you once you have been accepted into the program.

### Account Registration and Onboarding Tasks
- You will receive an email invitation to activate your account. The email will come from [http://okta.com](http://okta.com), so please make sure that it doesn’t get caught in your email spam filter. Follow the steps outlined in the email to set up your password and your multi-factor authentication preferences. Clink on the link below to watch a video walking through the steps.

- In the **Management Portal**, you will notice a “Onboarding Tasks” section within “Admin Tasks” with a number of items you will need to complete before you can gain access to the project space. Refer to the next section for details about the onboarding process.

### Obtaining ADRF Access
- **Agency-affiliated researcher**. If you are an agency-affiliated researcher using an agency-sponsored account, you will be granted ADRF access once you complete your onboarding tasks and required data access agreements. If you are a self-paying agency-affiliated researcher, your ADRF access is conditional on receipt of payment. If your institution of Office of Sponsored Programs will be submitting payment on your behalf, please be aware of potential access delays. Whenever possible, the Coleridge Initiative advises paying with a personal credit card or institutional payment card and using the generated invoice to request reimbursement.
- **Individual part of a training program**. If you are part of a training program, you will be granted ADRF access once you complete your onboarding tasks and required data access agreements.
