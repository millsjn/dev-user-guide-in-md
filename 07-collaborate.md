# 7 How to Work Collaboratively in the ADRF

## Topics
- [Shared Folders](#shared-folders)
- [Sharing Restrictions](#sharing-restrictions)

## Shared Folders
Shared folders within a project are a great way to share information with other members on a team project. Remember that when working with teams you may not share the ADRF screen (even project folders) with other members on video platforms or otherwise, whether or not your team members are working on the same project.

## Sharing Restrictions
Again, remember that when working with teams you may not share the ADRF screen with other members on video platforms or otherwise, whether or not your team members are working on the same project.

The information contained in the ADRF is restricted to reside only in the ADRF for all purposes unless it passes Export Review. This means that it cannot be shared or potentially shared with any unauthorized parties. Do not write down any numbers or figures or tables corresponding to data in the ADRF. Copying and pasting is restricted, but manually circumventing this is also not permitted by your data agreements.
